I"ì<p>We decided to take a vacation and visit our land in Hartsel, Colorado, a land Kirill bought back in 2017. Since then we havenâ€™t had a chance to built anything on it, but the idea has always been very tempting. The location of the land is perfect: itâ€™s a minute away from Hartsel and 30 minutes away from Buena Vista. The land is a dream.</p>

<p>It was an exhausting 14 hour drive from Phoenix, Arizona, but it was totally worth it. Upon arrival we set up our tent and had a few beers while listening to music through the speakers connected to the converter that we plugged into the cigarette lighter.</p>

<p>The night was cold and a bit scary, because thatâ€™s when coyotes come out on the prowl, but as the morning came everything was back to normal.</p>

<p>For the longest time my brother and I were thinking about alternative ways of living, and owning a land totally allows for it.</p>
